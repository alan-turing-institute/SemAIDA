This [list] is chosen by me, Richard Lacayo, and my colleague Lev Grossman... Grossman and I each began by drawing up inventories of our nominees. Once we traded notes, it turned out that more than 80 of our separately chosen titles matched. (Even some of the less well-known ones, like At-Swim Two Birds.) We decided then that we would more or less divide the remaining slots between us. That would allow each of us to include books that the other might not have chosen. Or might not even have read...

A standard definition of the novel--an extended prose narrative--is so broad that it fails to limit the field usefully... I have been influenced in this regard, like many, by literary critic Ian Watt\u0027s groundbreaking 1957 study, The Rise of the Novel, which contends that the novel as a distinctive genre emerged in 18th-century England through the shifting of the emphasis of previous prose romances and their generalized and idealized characters, settings, and situations to a particularity of individual experience. In other words, the novel replaced the romance\u0027s interest in the general and the ideal with a concern for the particular. The here and now substituted for the romance\u0027s interest in the long ago and far away. As 18th-century novelist Clara Reece observed, \"The Novel is a picture of real life and manners, and of the times in which it was written. The Romance, in lofty and elevated language, describes what has never happened nor is likely to.\" Novelists began to represent the actual world accurately, governed by the laws of probability. ...It would be far too reductive and misleading, however, to define the novel only by its realism or accurate representation of ordinary life...
