It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel\u0027s will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van \u0027t Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van \u0027t Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In 2008, the prize was awarded to Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Y. Tsien, who shared the prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK (slightly more than ?1 million, or US$1.4 million).[4] The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel\u0027s death.[5]}","lastModified":"","textBeforeTable":"[edit] Laureates At least 25 laureates have received the Nobel Prize for contributions in the field of organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry.[6] Two winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize.
