XXI, No. 10 BRYN MAWR AND WAYNE, PA., WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 9, 1935 lopyrlght BKYN MAWR COLLEGE NEWS. 1934 PRICE 10 CENTS Varsity Dramatics Is To Be Reorganized Players\u0027 Club to Elect Officers of Dratnat Board and Make First Play Choice COLLEGE CHOOSES PLAY (Especially contributed by Mar- garet Kidder, \u002738.) The Varsity Dramatics board is an- nouncing a change in the organization of dramatics at Bryn Mawr. We should like to form a dramatic society to represent the college. The produc- tions of this society should be, in a general sense, the concern of the col- lege as a whole, not the work of a group of anxious individuals offered to the college for criticism. The mem- bers of this society will necessarily^! only those undergraduates who ta^l an active interest in the many sides of play production. But interested spectators should be able to feel thai the fullest use is being made of the dramatic potentialities of the college. This society shall elect new members from the succeeding classes; and it shall be governed by officers elected by itself and for itself. We hope that the Varsity Players\u0027 club, under a new regime, will become such an or- ganization. The present dramatic organiza- tion has always aimed at represent- ing the college; but its organization is rather ambiguous. The requirements for a dramatic society at a college must change as the undergraduate body changes and individuals rise and disappear. The history of dramatics at Bryn Mawr is a singularly varying one. The present organization is; comparatively recent and appears to be a combination of two elements that do not combine. There are two sepa- rate entities, the Varsity Players Club and the Varsity Dramatics, board, which represent two distinct and separate executive forces, a small committee that increases itself by se- lecting new members sparingly from the different classes, and a large soci- ety, of undergraduates interested in Dramatics, with a president elected by themselves. But the members of this society are selected by the Dramatics Board. It is difficult to understand the function of one of these bodies when one considers the existence of the other. The dramatics board is self-perpet- uating, like the editorial boards of the College News and the Lantern. It is not a closed corporation nor one little group of serious thinkers; but the choice of its members is a difficult problem since there are no general try-outs as in the case of the Lantern Continued on Page Three College Calendar Wednesday, January 9.

The Board of Governors of the Bryn Mawr Club of New York entertained the undergraduates at a tea in honor of the members of the classes of 1933 and 1934. The club rooms were pleas- antly crowded with many undergrad- uates and graduates living or vaca- tioning in New York, who attended. The members of the Board of Gover- nors who gave the tea were as follows: Mrs. Howard T. Oliver, 1916, the President of the Club; ftjrs. Richard N. Pierson, 1923; the Misses Kath- arine Van Bibber, 1924, and Katharine C. Ecob, 1909; Mrs. Albert Clay, 1924; Mrs. Orson L. St. John, 1930; Mrs. Gerald Cutler, 1922; Mrs. John C. Jutting, Jr., 1927; Miss Helen C. Schwarz, 1919; Mrs. Louis J. Darm- stadt, 1927; and the Misses Caroline F. Lexow,-1908, ftndTmogen R. Rich- ards, \u0027.930. Mrs. Henry E. Stehli, 1927. of the _ Membership Committee, assisted those of the Governors who received, while Miss Ella Katherine Berkeley, of the Class of 1933, the Misses Mary Nichols, Barbara Smith, Nancy Stevenson and Marion Hope, of the Class of 1934, and the Misses Diana Morgan and Sarah Flanders, of the Class of 1935, formed the re- ception committees of recent gradu- ates and of present undergraduates. New Rules for Honor Students to Extend Time for Books Instituted . POLICY AGAINST FINES The library has in recen* years tried to make its rules lenient enough to give all of Bryn Mawr full use of its books, with as much convenience to its readers as is possible. At the same time, the librarians have found that to maintain the most efficient and con- venient service it is necessary to en- force th^* rules rigidly. Consequently an -explanation of the library rules and of the policy behind them is nec- essary at intervals. To prevent popular books from be- ing taken out of circulation too much, a student may take only one New Book Room book at a time, and from the regular stacks she may take out two books of general reading and more books if they are needed for a report. Books must be returned at the end of two weeks, and may be renewed for another two weeks only if they are returned on time (i. e., before the re- ceipt of a first notice) and if no one else wishes to use them. If books are not returned on time and a notice has to be sent for their return, they may not be renewed but must be left in the stacks for three days before they may be taken again. If a sec- ond, as well as the first, notice for the return of a book is disregarded, the stack privileges of the student are withdrawn for two weeks. This means that all stack books must be returned and must be used in the Stack Room for that period. These penalties are necessary to prevent undue carelss- ness in the use and return of books and to give all users of the library a �fair chance to use the books. The policy of the library has always been against penalizing late return of books by money fines because of the ex- pense to scholarship students; and the removal of stack privileges was adopted as a fit penalty in that it did not actually deprive the student of the use of books, since she might still use books at the tables provided in the stacks proper. Since the institution of the Hon- ours system, the library has extended its rules so as to permit Honours students to use books over a- longer period of time. Such students are al- lowed to take as many books as is necessary for their .work, not exceed- ing thirty at a time, and to keep them for one semester. When signing the bookcards they must, however, desig- nate that they need the material for Honours. Otherwise, they come un- der the same rules as the other stu- dents. Also, students other than Hon- ours students who are working on long reports may ask for and receive the-\"long-time\" privilege. Permission has to be given, however, because many books are of a reference type and they should not be kept from gen- eral circulation indefinitely. Hockey Elections Barbara Cary, \u002736, and Sylvia Evans, \u002737, have been elected Captain and Manager respect- ively of the hockey team for 1935. Mr. Julien Bryan Will Show Russian Movies Marriage and Divorce Courts, Homes, Prisons, Theatres, Aviation Pictured SIBERIA IS FEATURED Julien Bryan, photographer and lecturer on Russia, is coming to talk and show motion pictures under the sponsorship of the Bryn Mawr Com- munity Center in Goodhart, Tuesday evening, January 15. The picture which he is going to show, Russia and Siberia, is the sequel to Russia As 11 Was; Russia As. It Is. Mr. Bryan is just returned with this amazing new record of Russian lifejfrom a four-months\u0027 trip, his fifth visit to the Soviet Union. He spent the first two months of last summer photographing in and around Moscow, Leningrad, ancient Novgorod and along the Volga. Finally, leaving these better known parts of Russia he went to Karelia to see the White Sea-Baltic Canal, scene of Madame Tchernavin\u0027s Escape from the Soviets, and 4,000 miles to eastern Siberia to Buryat, Mongolia. After a stop at Irkutsk, the well-known stopping point of round-the-world flyers, Mr. Bryan chartered a small fishing boat for a two weeks\u0027 trip to the fishing collec- tives of beautiful Lake Baikal, a journey that nearly ended in tragedy during a severe storm such as is fre- quently encountered on the lake, one of the most dangerous lakes and one of the largest inland bodies of water in the world. From there he contin- ued with much difficulty over the steppes and through the swamps to the northern Reindeer country of the primitive Tuturi Tungus, a Mongol- ian tribe that migrated into north- ern Siberia from Manchuria a thou- sand years ago and now lives there in a primitive and semi-nomad state. The movies he is planning to show include pictures of homes, hospitals, baby clinics, marriage and divorce courts, actual trials in the people\u0027s courts, Ambassador Bullitt and the Embassy, Czarist prisons in Siberia, Soviet aviation, Maxim Gorky, Nov- gorod and its churches, Soviet sur- gery, the new experimental theatres where actors mingle with the audience, the remarkable children\u0027s theatres, Lama temples and strange religious Continued on Page Four College Calamities The yawning trench in front of the Library which startled the eyes of returning students is the result of a college calamity. Last Friday a steam pipe burst and repairs were under- taken at once in order to insure heat for the halls. The men worked night and day, so that the repairs are now nearly completed. Mr. Dougherty, the college superintendent, fell into the hole while supervising the work and was painfully injured. The unusually dull lighting in the halls which met us on Sunday night was the result of a grounded electric cable. The college was forced to rely on reserve supplies of electricity and fearing that the reserves might run out \"candles were supplies to light us to bed. This precaution, however, proved unnecessary. Oxford Bows to Girls e American Rhodes scholar. *\"- Larson, from South Dakota, :ed a century-old Oxford Uni- versity tradition recently, when he forced the famous Union debating so- ciety to open its rooms to women stu- dents for the first time in its history. At the same time, Oxford men m*.ut it plain that their interest in co-eds was purely financial. Larson, as treasurer of the Union, persuaded its 800 members to let girls buy breakfasts and afternoon teas in the club\u0027s halls, because their shil- lings are needed to help finance a pro- posed $7,500 dining room. His pro- posal was accepted only after the American had promised that women \"will never be allowed to roam all over the place\" and that a special entrance would be provided for the feminine invaders. J \u003c Engagements and Marriages The Christmas vacation seems to have been most prolific in producing engagements, not to mention a mar- riage. Louise McCormick, \u002734, was married to Montgomery Orr at a small wedding in Chicago on January 4. Elizabeth Eaton, \u002735, has announc- ed her engagement to Lyman Butter- field. Eleanor Cheney, \u002735, has an- nounced her engagement to Robert Graves. Katherine Gribbel, \u002734, has announced her engagement to Ray- mond Carter,, and Leidy B. Saul, a former member of the class of *35 and now a Senior at Radcliffe, has an- nounced her engagement to Frederick Vandenberg. Katherine Pier, \u002733, has announced her engagement to Fred- erick Farwell. Investigation Shows We Are Jazz-Hounds Merion Has Largest Collection With Rockefeller Second in Song Hits PEM PREFERS CLASSICS Hats off to Merion for the largest and most varied collection of Jazz hits,�some, we must confess, in a sad state of disrepair. We would place Rock second, since it has a cou- ple of drawers of discarded favorites, besides the more recent songs. Den- bigh, though equipped with a smaller collection, is reasonably up-to-date. For classical music, however, we must go to the Pembrokes, East especial- ly, where several students have pri- vate collections of the great compos- ers. Wagner and Tschaikowsky are well represented, we found, while some students enjoy German songs and yodelling in their lighter mo- ments. The ideal Bryn Mawr Jazz-lover, as Plato might say, goes in for astrono- my. Almost anywhere one may hear the wheezy hall victrola, generally greatly in need of a new n^edlf\", croon- ing Stars Fell on Alabama, I Saw Stars or Stardust. In most o� the halls we also frequently hear Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Love in Bloom. Much to our surprise we found that the hall traditions in victrola playing vary considerably. All the halls ex- cept Pern West have an officially pub- lic vie, but not all have public collec- tions of records. The latter is not such a bad idea we think, as we re- flect on some of the distinctly obnox- ious nieces hanging on in the more economical halls. An inspection of the record depositories in the halls which have them reveals that Pu-hvzi Mr. Hemingway was once a univer- sal favorite. At least two of the halls own such out-dated numbers as Kan- sas City Kitty and Seven Years With the Wrong Woman, besides newer se- lections like Here Comes the British Continued on Page Three Ossinsky Describes Planning in U.S.S.R. Statistics from Industry Are Correlated to Form Basis of Yearly Plans LIT NG STANDARD RISES Deanery, January 7, 1935. Before a large and interested gath- ering, Mr. V. Valery Ossinsky de- scribed How Plans Are Made in Sov- iet Russia. Mr. Ossinsky is director of the National Bureau of Economic Accounting which forms one of the two main divisions of the central plan- ning body, the Gosplan. In order to discuss planning as it is done in Russia, something must be said of the social background of plan- ning. The most imperative need in Russia has always been the necessity for a rapid advance in industrial pro- duction. The first step in this direc- tion is the socialization of all means of transportation, production and dis- tribution. The second is a central- ized control of planning under a spe- cial commissariat for each \u0027economic group, leading up to a central plan- ning body. The third requirement is the abolition of classes and social di- visions of labor. An important corol- lary of this is the raising of the standard of living of the wage earn- ers. Planning cannot be either accurate or useful unless there is a correct sta- tistical estimate of the state of the country preceding the\u0027 plan, and these figures must form the basis of com- parison for future progress. In Rus- sia there is a special department which collects and edits these statis- tics, directly connected with the Gos- plan. Each economic unit has to send statistical reports to this department on specific dates in the year. The re- ports go to the commissariat for each industrial group. The commissariats send summaries of these reports to the Central Bureau, which edits them. The Gosplan also analyzes the signifi- cance of the statistics and makes them the basis of future plans. In this way the second Five Year plan came into being. After correlating the statistics, the Gosplan gives them to the Central Po- litical Bureau, which defines the limit figures of the future period. This must be done as concisely and accu- rately as possible, and the statistics are then re-expressed to dramatize the aims and purposes of the plan. The foundation of the first plan was the building up of a sound basis for the social economy. The most im- portant method of achieving this was the stimulation of production in the heavy industries, or the so-called Group A. The second plan aims at a completed social economy and stresses particularly the greater de- Contlnued on Page Four All We Know Is That the Papers Say We \"Barked\" Alarm at Our \"Peeping Tom\" There seems to be no getting away from the old proverb to the effect that it\u0027s a wise event that knows its own write-up. Once again its truth ha� been proved, and that on the Bryn Mawr campus. ^ The night bJtore Christm\u0026S vaca- tion at about the hour of midnight, a student was packing in anticipa- tion of the morrow, her mind flitting giddily over the high spots to come. Suddenly her train of thought was rudely arrested by a cu\u0027riQyafcscraping sound outride her* window. She tore oimrghtway to the smoking room and eventually, after several unsuccessful attempts, and one solitary return, per- suaded the students there to return with her.
