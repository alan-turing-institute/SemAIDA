It should be noted that the characters list is not extensive. Not all the characters featured in Grand Theft Auto IV are included despite some committing criminal acts prior; certain characters featured in the downloadable content (DLC) for Grand Theft Auto IV, The Lost And Damned and The Ballad Of Gay Tony may also be absent, presumably because the characters were only created during development of the DLCs, after the database list in Grand Theft Auto IV was finalized. Many characters from the game are profiled in this database, below is a list of the characters in alphabetical order on the left and their place of birth on the right. A humorous detail about the site is that the LCPD haven\u0027t actually restricted the database to authorized people (people with a password), but instead have a warning at the top of the page notifying that it is to be used by the LCPD only (noted at the top left corner","textAfterTable":"TriviaEdit The database has a couple of inconsistencies and false information. For example, it claims that Ray Bulgarin is dead throughout the events of the GTA IV trinity when he clearly is not. This is also the case with Jon Gravelli, Bledar Morina and Kalem Vulaj. Also, the site is not always updated. If Playboy X dies, the site does not list him as deceased, as is the case with Joseph DiLeo and Luca Silvestri. The stylized eye above the text \"you have been warned\" is nearly identical to the real life Cryengine logo. GalleryEdit The LCPD Database in the in-game Internet Browser.
