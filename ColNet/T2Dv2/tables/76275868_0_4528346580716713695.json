levels, along with other compatible data (theology, eschatology, geographic proximity etc.), can identify potential alliances and strategies such as terrorism by lower IQs toward higher IQs.  Charles Murray advises that though \"Lynn and Vanhanen are good scholars, the data for a number of smaller countries and third-world countries are inadequate to be used confidently.\" However, their data is a starting point toward more accurate research.  (The preceding remarks in quotations are summarized excerpts from an e-mail exchange in March 2007 between Dallas F. Bell Jr. and Charles Murray, a noted researcher and [co] author of such books as The Bell Curve.), 8471\u003dReligion and eschatology are by percentages of the population.  From these figures T and E beliefs the P1, P2 and P3 can be determined.  Beyond basic accuracy concerns, the problem with the figures presented is that they identify people by religion and do not necessarily reflect the adherence to that religion\u0027s text considered sacred.  Those texts provide the fundamental rules for the belief system. For example, in the U.S. there is a majority percentage of the population identified as Christian but that does not give an indication of Bible believers. George Barna conducted a poll in March 2007 that indicates the number of U.S Bible believers is much smaller than the number of U.S. citizens identifying themselves as Christian. Therefore, the nonbelievers\u0027 behaviors will likely oscillate between compliance with natural laws of freewill (NLF) and noncompliance with NLF. This phenomenon is not unique to Christianity but applies to all theologies.  Based on the Muslim text or Qur\u0027an, Islamic law requires the murder or enslavement of nonbelievers which causes many people to deceitfully identify themselves as Muslim for survival. The information of religion percentage is helpful but data identifying fundamentalists would provide more insight into behavioral motives., 5223\u003dThe following flatfile of countries and territories contains raw data of five variables collated for the time period of 2007.  It may be used to make a plot on the 3D META template of systematic political science.  Past data can now be merged with this flatfile to make other plots and create a behavioral arc.  This is but one model using Excel spreadsheet.  For example, data could include only one variable for many time periods or only data for the x, y and z planes etc.  The primary resource for the first, second (z plane), third (x axis), fourth (x axis), sixth (x axis) and seventh (x axis) columns is the 2007 World Factbook.  The numbers for the fifth (z plane) column are derived from the book titled IQ and the Wealth of Nations by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen.  Their controversial effort is discussed further in the definition and explanation section for that column. , 11604\u003dIQs of individuals are determined by testing the problem-solving abilities for a specific chronological age within a given time limit.  The IQ test uses relatively knowledge neutral questions or situations involve identification of the relationships between several items, identifying the appropriate tool for a task and etc.  Primarily, using questions of knowledge is appropriate for college entrance tests but do not necessarily reflect problem-solving abilities, e.g. a question to list the birthdays of all the wives of U.S. presidents.  Intellectual abilities will be as obvious as identifying whether someone is physically seven feet tall or four feet tall.  It would not be wise to ignore either physical or intellectual differences.  People with T1 beliefs (John 3:16) see human differences and can appreciate both the giftedness of others and desire to help the needy.  They have hope that everyone is created with purpose and will find happiness doing that Divine calling.  The Bible commands believers not to think more highly of themselves than they ought (Romans 12:3).  Because, if a man thinks himself something when he is nothing he deceives himself (Galatians 6:3).  In lowness of mind let each esteem others better than one\u0027s self (Philippians 2:3).  Philippians 2:6-8 records Jesus, theanthropos (both God and man), thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation, and took upon himself the form of a servant.  Jesus humbled himself, and was obedient unto death, even on the cross.  Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God (the Father) and man (Luke 2:52).  He amazed scholars when he was twelve years old (Luke 2:46-47).  Jesus\u0027 human IQ and WQ are historically proven infinite by being the only person to have never violated NLF.  King David in Psalms 111:10 and King Solomon in Proverbs 9:10 state that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  The fear of the Lord is to hate evil; pride, arrogance and etc. (Proverbs 8:13). , 91732\u003d------------ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2007 DALLAS F.

When the income is observed to be disproportionately higher or lower than the potential implied by the other data usually there is an uneven distribution of resources or a bless/curse paradigm.      Literacy levels are calculated by percentages of total people; males and females over fifteen years of age that can read and write little more than their names.  Statistics are too high to be credible when large nation-states have a 99 percent or higher literacy rate.  For example, the U.S. has a significant subgroup of its population that can not read or write well enough to fill out an entry level job application form.  Those people are functionally illiterate and should be distinguished from those that are functionally literate.  *\u003e Indicates the figure is an estimate.                Symbol IQ levels, along with other compatible data (theology, eschatology, geographic proximity etc.), can identify potential alliances and strategies such as terrorism by lower IQs toward higher IQs.  Charles Murray advises that though \"Lynn and Vanhanen are good scholars, the data for a number of smaller countries and third-world countries are inadequate to be used confidently.\" However, their data is a starting point toward more","textAfterTable":"------------ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2007 DALLAS F.
