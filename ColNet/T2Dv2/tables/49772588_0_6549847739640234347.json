Catholic Church maintains that the number of American Catholics grew from 45 million in 1970 to 64.6 million in 2004.  But it was the increase in the Hispanic population, a majority of whom are illegal immigrants, from 9 million to 49.7 million, an increase of 40.7 million, who were solely responsible for that growth.  Of more significance is that the number of Whites claiming to be Catholics, according to the Catholic Church\u0027s own count, dropped 12.1 million (from 36 million to 23.9 million, a ONE THIRD DECREASE).  Based on the number of Whites who have fled this church in the wake of the Pedophile Priest Problem who are STILL counted as Catholics by the church, it would be OPTIMISTIC to assume that even half of them, or 12 million still CLAIM to be Catholics--which puts the REAL number of Catholics in this putative Christian nation at 11 million rather than 64.6 million, which means the church over-estimates its population figures by at least 53.6 million, or almost six fold, and that Catholics actually represent only 3.6% of our population rather than 22%., 75668\u003dThe Catholic migration to states in the South and West affects not just the geographic distribution of people but also the location of churches. During the 1990s, 413 Catholic congregations in the Northeastern United States2 closed shop and opened new churches, including 132 in the Southwest3 and 54 in the Southeast, where it\u0027s easier to recruit new members. In 2006, the Catholic Church appointed the first Roman Catholic cardinal in the state of Texas, recognizing the growth of the Catholic faithful from Mexico and Central America., 74052\u003dQuestions about religious affiliation seem to bubble to the surface during presidential election years. During the 2000 and 2004 elections, evangelical voters played a pivotal role in swinging the vote toward Republicans. This year, much attention has focused on Catholics (including Latinos and non-Hispanic whites), and Protestants in key battleground states, where candidates in both major parties have been pressed to express their religious convictions. As the racial and ethnic landscape continues to change, candidates will increasingly need to reach out to people representing a diversity of religious traditions., 78118\u003dThe Glenmary Research Center, which collects decennial data on religious congregations and \"adherents\" for the 50 states and the District of Columbia, reports that Catholics are one of the fastest-growing denominations in the country.1 Between 1990 and 2000, the number of Catholic adherents increased by more than 16 percent, while membership in many Protestant Churches declined. The Pentecostal and Mormon Churches are notable exceptions (see Figure 2)., 78939\u003dFigure 1 U.S. Hispanic/Latino and Catholic Populations, 1970 to 2000, 79417\u003dWhat explains the resilience of the Catholic Church in the face of declining membership over a lifetime? New immigrants arriving in the United States?many Catholics from Latin America?have helped offset the decline in religious affiliation among the U.S.-born population. Figure 1 shows the parallel growth in the U.S. Catholic and Latino population between 1970 and 2000., 84055\u003d\"Since Catholic education in America peaked in 1965, half of the nation?s Catholic schools have shut their doors, with an average of 250 closing per year. Many of these schools have been in inner cities, making the closings a particularly tragic development for disadvantaged students, who?ve benefited tremendously from the orderly environment and first-rate instruction that these institutions provide and who now have no educational alternative but failing public schools., 79740\u003dYet with 62 million adherents, Catholics remain the single largest religious group in the United States. Long-term trends from the General Social Survey, from 1972 through 2006, point to a decline in Protestant religions but show remarkable stability in the proportion of Catholics in the population., 76041\u003dFigure 3 Percent Change in the Catholic Population in U.S. States, 1990 to 2000, 81966\u003d\"The American Religious Identification Survey, a national study being released today by Trinity College in Hartford, finds that the Catholic population of New England fell by more than 1 million in the past two decades, even while the overall population of the region was growing.
