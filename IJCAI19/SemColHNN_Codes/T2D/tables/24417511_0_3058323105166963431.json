I believe in the preservation of old cardboard, and the American spirit. My interests are vintage baseball cards, collecting pre-WWII, and pre 1980 cards. I\u0027ve been collecting mostly baseball cards since I was a kid in the mid 80\u0027s. I\u0027m a fan of all sports, but partial to baseball and football. As far as memorabilia, I only collect vintage baseball cards. I\u0027m a member of Vintage Card Traders (VCT) and Old Baseball Cards (OBC). Take a look at my wantlist!, 5881\u003d1965 #  9, 14, 36, 43, 51, 52, 66, 79, 80, 85, 92, 97, 98, 101, 109, 143, 187, 485, 554, 6544\u003d1969 # 75, 137, 151, 158, 198, 222, 283, 317, 374, 441, 458, 468, 481, 490, 6700\u003d1970 #  19, 49, 84, 106, 125, 127, 132, 144, 175, 203, 242, 288, 325, 326, 7991\u003d1978 # 72, 173, 390, 431, 432, 467, 502, 8123\u003d1979 # 50, 200, 295, 417, 429, 498, 586, 600, 658, 700, 15974\u003d ---- 1953 Topps ----}","TableContextTimeStampAfterTable":"{124811\u003dCopyright ©2011}","lastModified":"","textBeforeTable":"More Tools LINK  · PRE  · CSV  · SHARESHARE [X]  · Glossary  · Hall of Fame Inductees Welcome to Wes\u0027s card wantlist and webpage!
