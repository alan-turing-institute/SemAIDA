We asked consumers to rate three components of the experience, Functional, Accessible, and Emotional, on a 7-point scale. For each component, we take the percentage of consumers that gave a rating of 6 or 7 and subtract the percentage that gave a rating of 1, 2, or 3. This results in a ?net goodness? rating for each of the three components. The overall Temkin Experience Rating is an average of the three ?net goodness? percentages. For more information, see the Temkin Experience Ratings Overview.
